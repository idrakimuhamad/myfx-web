# myfx

An app that allows you to retrieve the data from your Myfxbook portfolio, and place it all within one dashboard. The idea of the dashboard is not to show every single details. It is for a quick update on your portfolios, the total floats and current week's gain percentage.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with [Myfxbook API](https://www.myfxbook.com/api), deployed to [Now](http://now.sh).
